           - ul:
             - sysadmins
             - developers
             - IT managers
           - p: It's easy to write, read, maintain, and evolve - without writing scripts or custom code.
         -
           - h2: Fast
           - p: Ansible is easy to learn.
           - p: Setup is fast.
           - class_notes:
             - You can automate in under 30 minutes. Forget about how it works, just do it.
             - No agents. SSH keys are typically already in place.

           - h2: Complete
           - p: 'Ansible is several tools in one:'
           - ul:
             - configuration management
             - application deployment
             - orchestration
             - provisioning
           - p: Hundreds of built-in modules.
         -
           - h2: Efficient
           - p: Ansible doesn't require a custom agent or software to install. 
           - p: Ansible runs on OpenSSH. 
           - class_notes:
             - With no additional software infrastructure, you don't have to worry about managing the management tool.
             - That means anywhere SSH goes, Ansible goes. It doesn't suck memory or CPU resources when it is not in use, and it was designed from day one to automate no-downtime rolling updates and multi-tier orchestration.

           - h2: Secure
           - p: No agent with and SSH transport. 
           - p: Ansible plays can be read by anyone. 
           - class_notes:
             - It doesn't need additional ports or root level daemons.
             - It uses built-in OS authentication for better security - login as who you are, sudo if you want to sudo.
             - You can work with tools like Kerberos, LDAP, and sssd.
             - OpenSSH is the most peer-reviewed security component around.
             - This makes it auditable. You know what you're automating, and bugs have nowhere to hide.
