         - class_notes: |
             Discuss play controls such as sudo, remote_user, etc.
             Discuss variables. Show the list of tasks and how
             all finish one before going on to the next. Mention serial
             as a way to control how hosts flow through the tasks.
             Multiple plays can be written into a playbook.
