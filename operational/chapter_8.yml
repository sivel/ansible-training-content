        - h1: Best Practices
        - ul:
          - content organization
          - version control
          - role based access control
          - platform variance in playbooks
          - proper naming of plays, tasks, and handlers
          - playbook formatting
        - class_notes: |
            Best practices are not just conformity for conformity sake.
            They will help simplify code, smooth out collaboration, and
            avoid gotchas.
      - 
        - h2: Content Organization
        - p: Magic happens when you put your files in the right locations
        - ul:
          - ansible.cfg
          - inventory
          - variables and inclusions
          - tasks
          - handlers
          - playbooks
          - templates and files for use in tasks
          - custom modules
          - roles
        - class_notes: |
            Ansible looks in ANSIBLE_CONFIG, ./ansible.cfg, ./.ansible.cfg
            and /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg in that order. (1.5 switched
            ANSIBLE_CONFIG and ./ansible.cfg order)
            Inventory is looked for in config directive, ANSIBLE_HOSTS,
            /etc/ansible/hosts in that order.
            host_vars / group_vars relative to inventory and playbook
            basedirs
            file inclusions are relative to the playbook (vars, tasks,
            handlers, playbooks, templates, etc...)
            Custom modules go in library/ relative to playbook
            roles are in roles/ relative to playbook, and have
            files, templates, tasks, handlers, vars, meta all relative
            to the role itself, making for portability.

      - 
        - h2: Version Control
        - p: Version control and Ansible go hand in hand. This topic will walk through many of the benefits of storing your ansible content in SCM and why this is itself a best practice.
      - 
        - h2: Version Control
        - h3: audit trail / RBAC
        - class_notes: |
            Version control provides a record of who changed what, when, and
            why, the audit trail. It can also be a part of RBAC strategy,
            providing a gateway to who can commit to the playbook content.
      - 
        - h2: Version Control
        - h3: collaboration and preservation
        - class_notes: |
            A centralized (or distributed) store of the content protects
            against localized disaster. It also allows for better collaboration
            than just passing files back and forth, or co-editing a single
            directory.

        - h2: Version Control
        - h3: DevOps tie-in
        - class_notes: DevOps best practices dictate code to be deployed is already in SCM, natural extension to put code that does the deploying in SCM as well
      - 
        - h2: Version Control
        - h3: Galaxy, Git, and You!
        - ul:
          - role sharing
          - joys of modular playbooks
          - deploying code with the git module in a role
        - class_notes: GALAXY!
      - 
        - h2: Version Control
        - h3: Sensitive information handling
        - class_notes: VAULT!
      - 
        - h2: Version Control
        - h3: Barriers to entry
        - ul:
          - pull requests
          - automatic gateway tests
          - local validation checks
        - class_notes: |
            All these things can work together to add quality assurance to your
            content. Using pull or change requests gives a human the
            opportunity to review. Automated tests can tie into them, or be
            ran post-commit to continuously validate. Localized hooks can be
            used to validate after pulling changes in.

        - h2: RBAC and execution model
        - p: A discussion of RBAC, Ansible, and your team, as well as a comparison of execution stratagies
      - 
        - h2: RBAC and execution model
        - h3: RBAC
        - class_notes: |
            Role Based Access Control is used in many organizations
            to seperate out who has access to do what within environments.
            Often required for parts of public companies.  Sometimes at
            odds with DevOps philosophy of self-service.
      - 
        - h2: RBAC and execution model
        - h3: Execution models
        - ul:
          - centralized
          - distributed
        - class_notes: A comparison and contrast of centralized and distributed execution models. Not to be confused with push and pull.
      - 
        - h2: RBAC and execution model
        - h3: Centralized
        - ul:
          - access defined by company standards
          - layer of protection against accidents and malice
          - repeatability and guaranteed working environment
          - ITIL/Change Control process friendly
        - class_notes: |
            A single point from which to either push changes from, or
            have ansible-pull fetch changes from. Can configure systems to
            only allow Ansible logins from this host with a particular key
            Host can be locked down and managed to ensure unwanted changes
            don't creep in and disrupt ability to do repeat runs
      - 
        - h2: RBAC and execution model
        - h3: Distributed
        - ul:
          - rapid development and execution loop
          - change control put in hands of playbook/code devs
          - turns operational support from gatekeeping to enabling
          - aligns with other self-service IT services
          - you built it, you deploy it
        - class_notes: |
            Each developer could be a distributor, or individual
            systems could point to individual sources for ansible-pull
            Higher security risk, higher risk of run environment change
            but tradeoff for more flexibility and rapid dev/deploy times

        - h2: Platform Variance in playbooks
        - p: Best practices for dealing with the challenge of heterogeneous environments
      - 
        - h2: Platform Variance in playbooks
        - h3: group_by
        - p: Create dyanmic groups matching certain criteria
        - code: |
            - name: grouping play
              hosts: all
              tasks:
                 - name: create distro groups
                   group_by: key={{ ansible_distribution }}

            - name: CentOS play
              hosts: CentOS
              gather_facts: False
              tasks:
                 - # tasks that only happen on CentOS go here
        - class_notes: Note that roles could also be used here, driven by group_by.
      - 
        - h2: Platform Variance in playbooks
        - h3: task conditionals
        - code: |
             - name: install nginx
               yum: name=nginx state=present
               when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS'

             - name: install nginx
               apt: pkg=nginx state=present
               when: ansible_distribution == 'Debian'
        - class_notes: A more simple way to deal, could clutter up a large playbook / role set.
      - 
        - h2: Proper naming of plays, tasks, and handlers
        - p: Names have significance
        - ul:
          - --start-at-task
          - handler notification
          - output review
        - code: |
            $ ansible-playbook play.yaml --start-at-task="a good task"

              - name: a good task
                file: path=/etc/foobar state=absent
                notify: bounce foo service

            handlers:
              - name: bounce foo service
                service: name=foo state=restarted
        - class_notes: |
            Names have meaning. task names in --start-at-task,
            handler names for notify. Play names are less important
            but uniqueness helps when debugging output

        - h2: Playbook formatting
        - p: whitespace, yaml, line lengths, oh my!
      - 
        - h2: Playbook formatting
        - h3: order and style of playbook directives
        - ul:
          - use a name
          - hosts next
          - other options
          - tags
          - vars after a blank line
          - tasks after a blank line
        - code: |
            - name: Generate env/cell specific content
              hosts: localhost
              connection: local
              gather_facts: false
              tags:
                - localprep

              vars:
                - cachedir: cache/

              tasks:
                - name: stuff
        - class_notes: |
            There is no hard order that things must appear in a playbook,
            however if anybody ever looks at your files they will expect
            an order. Blank lines help to visually separate logical blocks
            of the play and between plays.
      - 
        - h2: Playbook formatting
        - h3: whitespace, line lengths, continuations
        - ul:
          - blank lines encouraged
          - less than 80 chars wide
          - blocks can continue on new lines with proper spacing
        - code: |
            tasks:
              - name: one task
                command: echo

              - name: lots of arguments
                rax_dns_record: credentials=/path/to/my/creds type=A
                                data=4.2.2.2 name=www.nodomain.not
        - class_notes: |
            Playbook syntax is friendly to line continuation, make use of that
            to keep your lines under 80 chars. Wrap the text to be at the same
            indent level as the preceeding data block, as seen in the example
      - 
        - h2: Playbook formatting
        - h3: to quote or not to quote
        - ul:
          - "quote strings that have a : in them"
          - "quote variables if they come directly after a :"
          - "quote strings that use * directly after a :"
          - quote entire string if first character is a quote
        - code: |
            - name: "My name has a : in it"
              command: "{{ variable_here }}"
              when: "'some_string' in varaible_here"

            hosts: "*-webs"
        - class_notes: |
            quoting is a yaml gotcha. It often trips people up. These
            rules here will help you avoid most/all quoting gotchas.
      - 
        - h2: Playbook formatting
        - h3: variable referencing
        - ul:
          - use {{ }} almost always
          - do not use {{ }} in conditionals and other task controllers
        - code: |
            - name: name here
              command: echo {{ variable here }}
              register: output
              when: variable != "derp"
              failed_when: output.stderr == "FAILURE"
        - class_notes: |
            Variable decoration is another gotcha. Task controllers can be
            treated like lines of python, where variables are referenced
            without decoration and raw strings need quotes.
