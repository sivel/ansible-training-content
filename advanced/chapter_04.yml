        - h1: Jinja2 Templates
        - p: I mustache you a question.

      -
        - h2: Jinja2 Templates
        - ul:
            - Delimiters
            - Control Structures
            - Jinja2 Environment
            - Python Data Types
            - Filters and Tests

      -
        - h2: Delimiters
        - code: |
            {{ variable }}
        - code: |
            {% for server in groups.webservers %}
        - class_notes: There are 2 (default) delimiters in jinja2. The first prints the result of the expression. The latter is used to execute statements such as for loops or assigning values.

      -
        - h2: Control Structures
        - p: |
            <ul>
              <li>for</li>
              <li>if</li>
              <li>macros</li>
              <li>call</li>
              <li>filters</li>
              <li>assignments</li>
              <li>extends</li>
              <li>block</li>
              <li>include</li>
              <li>import</li>
            </ul>
        - class_notes: This is a list of all control strucutres as mentioned in the jinja2 docs.  The ones most people need to know about are "for" and "if".  Point students to <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/">http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/</a> for additional information about the other types.

      -
        - h2: For Loop
        - code: |
            {% for server in groups.webservers %}
            {{ hostvars[server].ansible_default_ipv4.address }}
            {% endfor %}
        - class_notes: Ending a control structure in jinja2 is generally done with endTYPE, where TYPE in the above case is "for".

      -
        - h2: If Statement
        - code: |
            {% if server == inventory_hostname %}
            {{ 127.0.0.1 }}
            {% else if server in groups.database %}
            {{ hostvars[server].ansible_eth1.address }}
            {% else %}
            {{ hostvars[server].ansible_default_ipv4.address }}
            {% endif %}
        - class_notes: This is an example of an if/else if/else statement, nothing too special here.

      -
        - h2: Accessing Variables from Other Hosts
        - p: The "hostvars" variable contains facts for all hosts that have had facts gathered.
        - code:
            hostvars['web01'].ansible_eth1.address
        - class_notes: Group variables are not held independent of the hosts. During inventory parsing, group vars are merged into the individual hosts facts.

      -
        - h2: Manipulating Jinja2 Environment
        - p: Ansible configures jinja2 with a set of sane defaults. In some cases these defaults are not optimal, usually in the case of variable_start_string or trim_blocks. The first line of a jinja2 template can include a jinja2 environment configuration line
        - code: |
            #jinja2:variable_start_string:'[%' , variable_end_string:'%]'
        - class_notes: This example shows changing "{{ ... }}" to "[% ... %]". This is valuable in the case where you may need to use the "{{" or "}}" strings in your template that are not part of jinja2. <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/api/#jinja2.Environment">http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/api/#jinja2.Environment</a>

      -
        - h2: Jinja2 Variables are Python Data Types
        - p: In some cases there will not be Jinja2 filters that do what you want, such as a lack of a "split" filter. This can be achieved using the ".split()" method on a python string object.
        - code: |
            {% set servers = "server1,server2,server3" %}
            {% for server in servers.split(",") %}
            {{ server }}
            {% endfor %}

      -
        - h2: Filters and Tests
        - p: Jinja2 provides you with a number of filters and tests to manipulate and test data. Ansible also provides a number of filters.

            - http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_variables.html#jinja2-filters

      -
        - h2: Filters
        - p: Filters are invoked similarly to unix shell pipes and manipulate variables and return the results
        - code: |
            variable | replace("-", "_")
        - p: This is equivalent to
        - code: |
            replace(variable, "-", "_")

      -
        - h2: Tests
        - p: Tests can be used to test a variable against a common expression
        - code: |
            {% if variable is defined %}
