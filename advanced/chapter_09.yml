            In this chapter we discuss delegation, how tasks in a play
            can be redirected to an alternate host for execution.
            What use cases can you think of for looping over hosts to
            execute a task, but have that task execute somewhere else?

      - 
        - h2: Delegation
        - ul:
          - Local actions and actions on other hosts
          - Delegation to a host in inventory
          - Delegation to a host not in inventory
          - Task execution concurrency with delegation
        - class_notes: |
            Actions can be done locally, or on another system in your
            inventory, or out of your inventory. Execution concurrency
            is a concern as well.

      - 
        - h2: Local actions and actions on other hosts
        - p: "Task control keyword: delegate_to"
        - code: |
            - name: take out of load balancer pool
              command: /usr/bin/take_out_of_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}
              delegate_to: localhost

            - name: update packages
              yum: name=acme-web-stack state=latest

            - name: add back to load balancer pool
              command: /usr/bin/add_back_to_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}
              delegate_to: localhost
        - class_notes: |
            The delegate_to keyword is what tells Ansible to redirect the
            task to the system listed. The variables you reference are
            attached to the host in the loop, not the host you are
            delegating to. So the task has the context of the host in the
            loop but it just gets executed on the host you delegate to.

            Is there another way to indicate that an action needs to
            happen locally?

      -
        - h2: Delegation to a host in inventory
        - p: Delegation most often targets another host in your inventory
        - p: Uses connection variable data from delegate target
        - ul:
          - ansible_connection
          - ansible_ssh_host
          - ansible_ssh_port
          - ansible_ssh_user
          - etc...
        - class_notes: |
            When delegating to a host listed in your inventory, data
            from your delegation target will be used when creating the
            connection to the delegation target, but only the connection
            related variables. The rest will be read from the host in the
            loop.

        - h2: Delegation to a host not in inventory
        - p: "Delegation: not just limited to hosts in your inventory"
        - p: Make use of add_host to adjust connection details
        - code: |
            - name: add delegation host
              add_host: name=hubert ansible_ssh_host=192.168.10.2
                        ansible_ssh_user=fred
        - class_notes: |
            You can also delegate to a host that doesn't exist in your
            inventory. In this case, ansible will use the string provided
            verbatim and attempt to connect to it with the current connection
            type and details. If you need to adjust the connection details,
            make use of the add_host task to create an ephemeral host in your
            inventory with connection data defined.

        - h2: Lab
        - p: Create an ephemeral host and delegate a task to it
        - ul:
          - Create a play for localhost
          - Create a host using add_host with detailed connection variables
          - Create a simple task that is delegated to the added host
          - Run playbook with -vvvv to observe the connection details
        - class_notes: |
            This is a simple contrived lab that will exercise making use of
            add_host to create an ephemeral host to delegate a task to. This
            host doesn't have to actually exist, a connection failure on the
            task will suffice to see the connection details to observe the
            delegation. Feel free to play with values and observe how they
            reflect in running the lab.

            - name: test play
              hosts: localhost

              tasks:
                - name: add delegation host
                  add_host: name=hubert ansible_ssh_host=192.168.10.2
                            ansible_ssh_user=fred

                - name: silly echo
                  command: echo {{ inventory_hostname }}
                  delegate_to: hubert

        - code: |
            $ ansible-playbook test-play.yml -vvvv

        - h2: Task execution concurrency with delegation
        - p: Delegated tasks will run for every host in the loop
        - p: Tasks will run with configured forks / serial
        - p: Be aware of race conditions and concurrency issues
        - class_notes: |
            Delegated tasks will run for every host in the hosts: , but this
            can create issues with race conditions, particularly when using
            conditionals in the task, as the forks count will be used to create
            multiple concurrent tasks. This can also create a thundering
            herd problem of too many connections opening at once to a single
            host. SSH servers have a MaxStartups config option that can limit
            how many concurrent connections it'll allow. Easy to overflow.

            What happens when you have five hosts in your set, five or more
            forks, a task that is conditional on the existence of a file, and
            the task creates the file. All five tasks will run at once, racing
            to create the file.

        - h2: Lab
        - p: Add mysql users to a database
        - ul:
          - Create a play to loop over 'webservers' group
          - Create a task to use mysql_user module to add a user
          - Use host specific mysql user / password data
          - delegate_to should be used to execute on the first 'databases' server

      -
        - h2: Sample Play
        - code: |
            ---
            - name: MySQL Users
              hosts: webservers

              tasks:
                - name: add a mysql user for the server
                  mysql_user: name={{ db_username }} host={{ inventory_hostname }}
                              password={{ db_password }} priv='ansible.*:ALL'
                              state=present
                  delegate_to: databases[0]
        - p: |
            When ran with -vvvv one can clearly see the connection debugging
            output which will show the delegation in action.
